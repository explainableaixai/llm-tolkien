{'45': 'Chapter 1\nA LONG-EXPECTED PARTY\nWhen Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly\nbe celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special mag-\nnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.\nBilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder\nof the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance\nand unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his\ntravels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly believed,\nwhatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of\ntunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame,\nthere was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it\nseemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the\nsame as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him well-preserved; but\nunchanged would have been nearer the mark. There were some that\nshook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it\nseemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual\nyouth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.\n‘It will have to be paid for,’ they said. ‘It isn’t natural, and trouble\nwill come of it!’\nBut so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous\nwith his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities\nand his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives\n(except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many de-\nvoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families.\nBut he had no close friends, until some of his younger cousins began\nto grow up.\nThe eldest of these, and Bilbo’s favourite, was young Frodo\nBaggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as his heir,\nand brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-\nBagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have\nthe same birthday, September 22nd. ‘You had better come and live\nhere, Frodo my lad,’ said Bilbo one day; ‘and then we can celebrate\nour birthday-parties comfortably together.’ At that time Frodo was\nstill in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties\nbetween childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.'}
{'46': 'understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for\nthat autumn. Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one, 111, a rather curious\nnumber, and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself\nhad only reached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33,an\nimportant number: the date of his ‘coming of age’.\nTongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of\nthe coming event travelled all over the Shire. The history and charac-\nter of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conver-\nsation; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences in\nwelcome demand.\nNo one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee,\ncommonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a\nsmall inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority,\nfor he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had\nhelped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that he was\nhimself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carried\non by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on\nvery friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill\nitself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.\n‘A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I’ve always\nsaid,’ the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very\npolite to him, calling him ‘Master Hamfast’, and consulting him\nconstantly upon the growing of vegetables – in the matter of ‘roots’,\nespecially potatoes, the Gaffer was recognized as the leading authority\nby all in the neighbourhood (including himself ).\n‘But what about this Frodo that lives with him?’ asked Old Noakes\nof Bywater. ‘Baggins is his name, but he’s more than half a Brandy-\nbuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go\nlooking for a wife away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.’\n‘And no wonder they’re queer,’ put in Daddy Twofoot (the\nGaffer’s next-door neighbour), ‘if they live on the wrong side of the\nBrandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That’s a dark bad\nplace, if half the tales be true.’\n‘You’re right, Dad!’ said the Gaffer. ‘Not that the Brandybucks\nof Buckland live in the Old Forest; but they’re a queer breed, seem-\ningly. They fool about with boats on that big river – and that isn’t\nnatural. Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as\nit may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish to\nmeet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all\nhis father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo\nBaggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was drownded.’\n‘Drownded?’ said several voices. They had heard this and other'}
{'47': '‘Well, so they say,’ said the Gaffer. ‘You see: Mr. Drogo, he\nmarried poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo’s\nfirst cousin on the mother’s side (her mother being the youngest of\nthe Old Took’s daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin.\nSo Mr. Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either\nway, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying\nat Brandy Hall with his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he\noften did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old\nGorbadoc keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out boating\non the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and\npoor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.’\n‘I’ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,’\nsaid Old Noakes; ‘and it was Drogo’s weight as sunk the boat.’\n‘And I heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,’\nsaid Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.\n‘You shouldn’t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,’ said the Gaffer,\nwho did not much like the miller. ‘There isn’t no call to go talking\nof pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that\nsit still without looking further for the cause of trouble. Anyway:\nthere was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might\nsay, among those queer Bucklanders, being brought up anyhow in\nBrandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc\nnever had fewer than a couple of hundred relations in the place. Mr.\nBilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to\nlive among decent folk.\n‘But I reckon it was a nasty knock for those Sackville-Bagginses.\nThey thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when he\nwent off and was thought to be dead. And then he comes back and\norders them off; and he goes on living and living, and never looking\na day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, and has\nall the papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses won’t never\nsee the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.’\n‘There’s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,’\nsaid a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving in the\nWestfarthing. ‘All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with\nchests of gold and silver, and jools, by what I’ve heard.’\n‘Then you’ve heard more than I can speak to,’ answered the\nGaffer. ‘I know nothing about jools. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money,\nand there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I saw\nMr. Bilbo when he came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I\nwas a lad. I’d not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my\ndad’s cousin), but he had me up at Bag End helping him to keep'}
{'48': 'a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I don’t\ndoubt they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign\nparts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there wasn’t\nenough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that.\nHe’s in and out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days, he\nis, and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo’s tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him\nhis letters – meaning no harm, mark you, and I hope no harm will\ncome of it.\n‘Elves and Dragons! I says to him. Cabbages and potatoes are better\nfor me and you. Don’t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters,\nor you’ll land in trouble too big for you, I says to him. And I might say\nit to others,’ he added with a look at the stranger and the miller.\nBut the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of\nBilbo’s wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger\ngeneration of hobbits.\n‘Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at\nfirst,’ argued the miller, voicing common opinion. ‘He’s often away\nfrom home. And look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves\ncoming at night, and that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf, and all.\nYou can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End’s a queer place, and\nits folk are queerer.’\n‘And you can say what you like, about what you know no more\nof than you do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,’ retorted the Gaffer, dislik-\ning the miller even more than usual. ‘If that’s being queer, then we\ncould do with a bit more queerness in these parts. There’s some not\nfar away that wouldn’t offer a pint of beer to a friend, if they lived\nin a hole with golden walls. But they do things proper at Bag End.\nOur Sam says that everyone’s going to be invited to the party, and\nthere’s going to be presents, mark you, presents for all – this very\nmonth as is.’\nThat very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A\nday or two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable\nSam) was spread about that there were going to be fireworks – fire-\nworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh\non a century, not indeed since the Old Took died.\nDays passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon\nladen with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening\nand toiled up the Hill to Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out\nof lamplit doors to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish folk, singing\nstrange songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A few of\nthem remained at Bag End. At the end of the second week in Sep-'}
{'49': 'He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf.\nHe had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond\nthe brim of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through\nHobbiton and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they\nrightly guessed. At Bilbo’s front door the old man began to unload:\nthere were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each\nlabelled with a large red G and the elf-rune, .\nThat was Gandalf ’s mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf\nthe Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his skill with\nfires, smokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult and\ndangerous, but the Shire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he\nwas just one of the ‘attractions’ at the Party. Hence the excitement\nof the hobbit-children. ‘G for Grand!’ they shouted, and the old man\nsmiled. They knew him by sight, though he only appeared in Hobbi-\nton occasionally and never stopped long; but neither they nor any\nbut the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays –\nthey now belonged to a legendary past.\nWhen the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had\nfinished unloading, Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single\nsquib or cracker was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the\nonlookers.\n‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf. ‘You will get plenty when the time\ncomes.’ Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door was\nshut. The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and\nthen made off, feeling that the day of the party would never come.\nInside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window\nof a small room looking out west on to the garden. The late afternoon\nwas bright and peaceful. The flowers glowed red and golden: snap-\ndragons and sunflowers, and nasturtians trailing all over the turf walls\nand peeping in at the round windows.\n‘How bright your garden looks!’ said Gandalf.\n‘Yes,’ said Bilbo. ‘I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear\nold Shire; but I think I need a holiday.’\n‘You mean to go on with your plan then?’\n‘I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven’t changed it.’\n‘Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan –\nyour whole plan, mind – and I hope it will turn out for the best, for\nyou, and for all of us.’\n‘I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have\nmy little joke.’\n‘Who will laugh, I wonder?’ said Gandalf, shaking his head.'}
{'50': 'The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts.\nThere might have been some grumbling about ‘dealing locally’, but\nthat very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind\nof provision, commodity, or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbi-\nton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood. People became\nenthusiastic; and they began to tick off the days on the calendar; and\nthey watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for invitations.\nBefore long the invitations began pouring out, and the Hobbiton\npost-office was blocked, and the Bywater post-office was snowed\nunder, and voluntary assistant postmen were called for. There was a\nconstant stream of them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of\npolite variations on Thank you, I shall certainly come.\nA notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: no admittance\nexcept on party business. Even those who had, or pretended to\nhave Party Business were seldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy:\nwriting invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, and\nmaking some private preparations of his own. From the time of\nGandalf ’s arrival he remained hidden from view.\nOne morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of\nBilbo’s front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents and pav-\nilions. A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road,\nand wide steps and a large white gate were built there. The three\nhobbit-families of Bagshot Row, adjoining the field, were intensely\ninterested and generally envied. Old Gaffer Gamgee stopped even\npretending to work in his garden.\nThe tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so\nbig that the tree that grew in the field was right inside it, and stood\nproudly near one end, at the head of the chief table. Lanterns were\nhung on all its branches. More promising still (to the hobbits’ mind):\nan enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the\nfield. A draught of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for miles\naround, arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that\nwere quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose to its height.\nThen the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eve\nof the Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday, September the\n22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags\nwere unfurled and the fun began.\nBilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety of enter-\ntainments rolled into one. Practically everybody living near was\ninvited. A very few were overlooked by accident, but as they turned\nup all the same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts\noftheShirewerealsoasked;andtherewereevenafewfromoutside'}
{'51': 'were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by\nthe gate. Hobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays.\nNot very expensive ones, as a rule, and not so lavishly as on this\noccasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton and\nBywater every day in the year was somebody’s birthday, so that every\nhobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least\nonce a week. But they never got tired of them.\nOn this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-\nchildren were so excited that for a while they almost forgot about\neating. There were toys the like of which they had never seen before,\nall beautiful and some obviously magical. Many of them had indeed\nbeen ordered a year before, and had come all the way from the\nMountain and from Dale, and were of real dwarf-make.\nWhen every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the\ngate, there were songs, dances, music, games, and, of course, food\nand drink. There were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner\n(or supper). But lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact that\nat those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together.\nAt other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking\n–continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, when the fireworks\nstarted.\nThe fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by\nhim, but designed and made by him; and the special effects, set\npieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him. But there was also\na generous distribution of squibs, crackers, backarappers, sparklers,\ntorches, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-\nclaps. They were all superb. The art of Gandalf improved with age.\nThere were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with\nsweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their\nleaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their\nshining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished\nhobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their\nupturned faces. There were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering\ninto the trees; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned\ninto eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was\na red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there was a forest\nof silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an\nembattled army, and came down again into the Water with a hiss\nlike a hundred hot snakes. And there was also one last surprise, in\nhonour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as Gandalf\nintended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped\nitself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow at the'}
{'52': 'his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times\nover the heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat on\ntheir faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somer-\nsault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.\n‘That is the signal for supper!’ said Bilbo. The pain and alarm\nvanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. There\nwas a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those\ninvited to the special family dinner-party. This was held in the great\npavilion with the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen\n(a number also called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word\nwas not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were\nselected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related,\nwith the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf ).\nMany young hobbits were included, and present by parental per-\nmission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the matter\nof sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting them\na free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender.\nThere were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and\nBrandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo Baggins’\ngrandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grand-\nfather); and a selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Brock-\nhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these\nwere only very distantly connected with Bilbo, and some had hardly\never been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of the\nShire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho and his wife\nLobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo, but\nso magnificent was the invitation card, written in golden ink, that\nthey had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo,\nhad been specializing in food for many years and his table had a high\nreputation.\nAll the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant\nfeast; though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of their\nhost (an inevitable item). He was liable to drag in bits of what he\ncalled poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or two, would allude to\nthe absurd adventures of his mysterious journey. The guests were\nnot disappointed: they had a very pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing\nentertainment: rich, abundant, varied, and prolonged. The purchase\nof provisions fell almost to nothing throughout the district in the\nensuing weeks; but as Bilbo’s catering had depleted the stocks of\nmost of the stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did\nnot matter much.\nAfter the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of the com-'}
{'53': 'favourite drinks, and nibbling at their favourite dainties, and their\nfears were forgotten. They were prepared to listen to anything, and\nto cheer at every full stop.\nMy dear People, began Bilbo, rising in his place. ‘Hear! Hear! Hear!’\nthey shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant\nto follow their own advice. Bilbo left his place and went and stood\non a chair under the illuminated tree. The light of the lanterns fell\non his beaming face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered\nsilk waistcoat. They could all see him standing, waving one hand in\nthe air, the other was in his trouser-pocket.\nMy dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again; and my dear Tooks\nand Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Horn-\nblowers, and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots.\n‘Proudfeet!’ shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion.\nHis name, of course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were\nlarge, exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.\nProudfoots, repeated Bilbo. Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I\nwelcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh\nbirthday: I am eleventy-one today! ‘Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy\nReturns!’ they shouted, and they hammered joyously on the tables.\nBilbo was doing splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked:\nshort and obvious.\nI hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am. Deafening\ncheers. Cries of Yes (and No). Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes\nand flutes, and other musical instruments. There were, as has been\nsaid, many young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had\nbeen pulled. Most of them bore the mark dale on them; which did\nnot convey much to most of the hobbits, but they all agreed they\nwere marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, but of\nperfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of\nthe young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to have\nfinished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got\nup an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master\nEverard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with\nbells in their hands began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance,\nbut rather vigorous.\nBut Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster nearby,\nhe blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. I shall not keep you\nlong, he cried. Cheers from all the assembly. I have called you all\ntogether for a Purpose. Something in the way that he said this made\nan impression. There was almost silence, and one or two of the Tooks\npricked up their ears.'}
{'54': 'among such excellent and admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst of\napproval.\nI don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less\nthan half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected and\nrather difficult. There was some scattered clapping, but most of them\nwere trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment.\nSecondly, to celebrate my birthday. Cheers again. I should say: OUR\nbirthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew,\nFrodo. He comes of age and into his inheritance today. Some perfunctory\nclapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of ‘Frodo! Frodo! Jolly\nold Frodo,’ from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and\nwondered what was meant by ‘coming into his inheritance’.\nTogether we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers were\nchosen to fit this remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use the expression.\nNo cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of the guests, and especially\nthe Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure they had only\nbeen asked to fill up the required number, like goods in a package.\n‘One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.’\nIt is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversary\nof my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the fact\nthat it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only\nfifty-one then, and birthdays did not seem so important. The banquet was\nvery splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember,\nand could only say ‘thag you very buch’. I now repeat it more correctly:\nThank you very much for coming to my little party. Obstinate silence.\nThey all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and\nthey were getting bored. Why couldn’t he stop talking and let them\ndrink his health? But Bilbo did not sing or recite. He paused for a\nmoment.\nThirdly and finally, he said, I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT.\nHe spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up\nwho still could. I regret to announce that – though, as I said, eleventy-one\nyears is far too short a time to spend among you – this is the END. I am\ngoing. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!\nHe stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of\nlight, and the guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo\nwas nowhere to be seen. One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted\nhobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed his feet\nfrom the table and stamped. Then there was a dead silence, until\nsuddenly, after several deep breaths, every Baggins, Boffin, Took,\nBrandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brock-'}
{'55': 'food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance.\n‘He’s mad. I always said so,’ was probably the most popular comment.\nEven the Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought Bilbo’s behaviour\nwas absurd. For the moment most of them took it for granted that\nhis disappearance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank.\nBut old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an\nenormous dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-\nlaw, Esmeralda: ‘There’s something fishy in this, my dear! I believe\nthat mad Baggins is off again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He\nhasn’t taken the vittles with him.’ He called loudly to Frodo to send\nthe wine round again.\nFrodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some\ntime he had sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair, and ignored all\nremarks and questions. He had enjoyed the joke, of course, even\nthough he had been in the know. He had difficulty in keeping from\nlaughter at the indignant surprise of the guests. But at the same\ntime he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he loved the\nold hobbit dearly. Most of the guests went on eating and drinking\nand discussing Bilbo Baggins’ oddities, past and present; but the\nSackville-Bagginses had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not\nwant to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for more\nwine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently\nto the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion.\nAs for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he\nhad been fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic ring that\nhe had kept secret for so many years. As he stepped down he slipped\nit on his finger, and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton\nagain.\nHe walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listen-\ning with a smile to the din in the pavilion, and to the sounds of\nmerrymaking in other parts of the field. Then he went in. He took\noff his party clothes, folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper his\nembroidered silk waistcoat, and put it away. Then he put on quickly\nsome old untidy garments, and fastened round his waist a worn\nleather belt. On it he hung a short sword in a battered black-leather\nscabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls, he took out\nan old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if they were very\nprecious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that their\noriginal colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark\ngreen. They were rather too large for him. He then went into his\nstudy, and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in'}
{'56': 'bag that was standing there, already nearly full. Into the envelope he\nslipped his golden ring, and its fine chain, and then sealed it, and\naddressed it to Frodo. At first he put it on the mantelpiece, but\nsuddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket. At that moment\nthe door opened and Gandalf came quickly in.\n‘Hullo!’ said Bilbo. ‘I wondered if you would turn up.’\n‘I am glad to find you visible,’ replied the wizard, sitting down in a\nchair, ‘I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose you\nfeel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?’\n‘Yes, I do,’ said Bilbo. ‘Though that flash was surprising: it quite\nstartled me, let alone the others. A little addition of your own, I\nsuppose?’\n‘It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and\nit seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that\nwould seem to explain your sudden vanishment.’\n‘And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,’\nlaughed Bilbo, ‘but I expect you know best, as usual.’\n‘I do – when I know anything. But I don’t feel too sure about this\nwhole affair. It has now come to the final point. You have had your\njoke, and alarmed or offended most of your relations, and given the\nwhole Shire something to talk about for nine days, or ninety-nine\nmore likely. Are you going any further?’\n‘Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have\ntold you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don’t expect I shall\nreturn. In fact, I don’t mean to, and I have made all arrangements.\n‘I am old, Gandalf. I don’t look it, but I am beginning to feel it\nin my heart of hearts. Well-preserved indeed!’ he snorted. ‘Why, I feel\nall thin, sort of stretched, if you know what I mean: like butter that\nhas been scraped over too much bread. That can’t be right. I need\na change, or something.’\nGandalf looked curiously and closely at him. ‘No, it does not\nseem right,’ he said thoughtfully. ‘No, after all I believe your plan is\nprobably the best.’\n‘Well, I’ve made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains\nagain, Gandalf – mountains; and then find somewhere where I can\nrest. In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and\na string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell. I might find\nsomewhere where I can finish my book. I have thought of a nice\nending for it: and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.’\nGandalf laughed. ‘I hope he will. But nobody will read the book,\nhowever it ends.’\n‘Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as'}
{'57': '‘He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact he\noffered to once, just before the party. But he does not really want\nto, yet. I want to see the wild country again before I die, and the\nMountains; but he is still in love with the Shire, with woods and\nfields and little rivers. He ought to be comfortable here. I am leaving\neverything to him, of course, except a few oddments. I hope he will\nbe happy, when he gets used to being on his own. It’s time he was\nhis own master now.’\n‘Everything?’ said Gandalf. ‘The ring as well? You agreed to that,\nyou remember.’\n‘Well, er, yes, I suppose so,’ stammered Bilbo.\n‘Where is it?’\n‘In an envelope, if you must know,’ said Bilbo impatiently. ‘There\non the mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!’ He hesitated.\n‘Isn’t that odd now?’ he said softly to himself. ‘Yet after all, why not?\nWhy shouldn’t it stay there?’\nGandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam\nin his eyes.‘I think, Bilbo,’ he said quietly, ‘I should leave it behind.\nDon’t you want to?’\n‘Well yes – and no. Now it comes to it, I don’t like parting with\nit at all, I may say. And I don’t really see why I should. Why do you\nwant me to?’ he asked, and a curious change came over his voice. It\nwas sharp with suspicion and annoyance. ‘You are always badgering\nme about my ring; but you have never bothered me about the other\nthings that I got on my journey.’\n‘No, but I had to badger you,’ said Gandalf. ‘I wanted the truth.\nIt was important. Magic rings are – well, magical; and they are rare\nand curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may\nsay; and I still am. I should like to know where it is, if you go\nwandering again. Also I think you have had it quite long enough.\nYou won’t need it any more, Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.’\nBilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly\nface grew hard. ‘Why not?’ he cried. ‘And what business is it of yours,\nanyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I\nfound it. It came to me.’\n‘Yes, yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is no need to get angry.’\n‘If I am it is your fault,’ said Bilbo. ‘It is mine, I tell you. My own.\nMy Precious. Yes, my Precious.’\nThe wizard’s face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker\nin his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. ‘It\nhas been called that before,’ he said, ‘but not by you.’\n‘But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same'}
{'58': 'Bilbo,’ he said. ‘You make that clearer with every word you say. It\nhas got far too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go\nyourself, and be free.’\n‘I’ll do as I choose and go as I please,’ said Bilbo obstinately.\n‘Now, now, my dear hobbit!’ said Gandalf. ‘All your long life we\nhave been friends, and you owe me something. Come! Do as you\npromised: give it up!’\n‘Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!’ cried Bilbo. ‘But you\nwon’t get it. I won’t give my Precious away, I tell you.’ His hand\nstrayed to the hilt of his small sword.\nGandalf ’s eyes flashed. ‘It will be my turn to get angry soon,’ he\nsaid. ‘If you say that again, I shall. Then you will see Gandalf the\nGrey uncloaked.’ He took a step towards the hobbit, and he seemed\nto grow tall and menacing; his shadow filled the little room.\nBilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching\nat his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another, and the air\nof the room tingled. Gandalf ’s eyes remained bent on the hobbit.\nSlowly his hands relaxed, and he began to tremble.\n‘I don’t know what has come over you, Gandalf,’ he said. ‘You\nhave never been like this before. What is it all about? It is mine isn’t\nit? I found it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn’t kept it.\nI’m not a thief, whatever he said.’\n‘I have never called you one,’ Gandalf answered. ‘And I am not one\neither. I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I wish you would\ntrust me, as you used.’ He turned away, and the shadow passed. He\nseemed to dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled.\nBilbo drew his hand over his eyes. ‘I am sorry,’ he said. ‘But I felt\nso queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with\nit any more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I\nhave felt it was like an eye looking at me. And I am always wanting\nto put it on and disappear, don’t you know; or wondering if it is safe,\nand pulling it out to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I\ncouldn’t rest without it in my pocket. I don’t know why. And I don’t\nseem able to make up my mind.’\n‘Then trust mine,’ said Gandalf. ‘It is quite made up. Go away\nand leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will\nlook after him.’\nBilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he\nsighed. ‘All right,’ he said with an effort. ‘I will.’ Then he shrugged\nhis shoulders, and smiled rather ruefully. ‘After all that’s what this\nparty business was all about, really: to give away lots of birthday-\npresents, and somehow make it easier to give it away at the same'}
{'59': '‘Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,’\nsaid Gandalf.\n‘Very well,’ said Bilbo, ‘it goes to Frodo with all the rest.’ He drew\na deep breath. ‘And now I really must be starting, or somebody else\nwill catch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn’t bear to do it all\nover again.’ He picked up his bag and moved to the door.\n‘You have still got the ring in your pocket,’ said the wizard.\n‘Well, so I have!’ cried Bilbo. ‘And my will and all the other\ndocuments too. You had better take it and deliver it for me. That\nwill be safest.’\n‘No, don’t give the ring to me,’ said Gandalf. ‘Put it on the mantel-\npiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes. I shall wait for him.’\nBilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by\nthe clock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on the floor.\nBefore he could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and set\nit in its place. A spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbit’s face\nagain. Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh.\n‘Well, that’s that,’ he said. ‘Now I’m off !’\nThey went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick from\nthe stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out of different\nrooms where they had been busy.\n‘Is everything ready?’ asked Bilbo. ‘Everything packed and labelled?’\n‘Everything,’ they answered.\n‘Well, let’s start then!’ He stepped out of the front-door.\nIt was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He\nlooked up, sniffing the air. ‘What fun! What fun to be off again, off\non the Road with dwarves! This is what I have really been longing\nfor, for years! Good-bye!’ he said, looking at his old home and bowing\nto the door. ‘Good-bye, Gandalf !’\n‘Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself ! You are\nold enough, and perhaps wise enough.’\n‘Take care! I don’t care. Don’t you worry about me! I am as happy\nnow as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time\nhas come. I am being swept off my feet at last,’ he added, and then\nin a low voice, as if to himself, he sang softly in the dark:\nThe Road goes ever on and on\nDown from the door where it began.\nNow far ahead the Road has gone,\nAnd I must follow, if I can,\nPursuing it with eager feet,\nUntil it joins some larger way'}
{'60': 'He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word he\nturned away from the lights and voices in the field and tents, and\nfollowed by his three companions went round into his garden, and\ntrotted down the long sloping path. He jumped over a low place in\nthe hedge at the bottom, and took to the meadows, passing into the\nnight like a rustle of wind in the grass.\nGandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness.\n‘Good-bye, my dear Bilbo – until our next meeting!’ he said softly\nand went back indoors.\nFrodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark,\ndeep in thought. ‘Has he gone?’ he asked.\n‘Yes,’ answered Gandalf, ‘he has gone at last.’\n‘I wish – I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a\njoke,’ said Frodo. ‘But I knew in my heart that he really meant to\ngo. He always used to joke about serious things. I wish I had come\nback sooner, just to see him off.’\n‘I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,’ said\nGandalf. ‘Don’t be too troubled. He’ll be all right – now. He left a\npacket for you. There it is!’\nFrodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it,\nbut did not open it.\n‘You’ll find his will and all the other documents in there, I think,’\nsaid the wizard. ‘You are the master of Bag End now. And also, I\nfancy, you’ll find a golden ring.’\n‘The ring!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘Has he left me that? I wonder why.\nStill, it may be useful.’\n‘It may, and it may not,’ said Gandalf. ‘I should not make use of\nit, if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going\nto bed.’\nAs master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye\nto the guests. Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over\nthe field, but Frodo would only say no doubt everything will be cleared\nup in the morning. About midnight carriages came for the important\nfolk. One by one they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied\nhobbits. Gardeners came by arrangement, and removed in wheel-\nbarrows those that had inadvertently remained behind.\nNight slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later.\nMorning went on. People came and began (by orders) to clear away\nthe pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and the spoons and knives\nand bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in'}
{'61': 'Then a number of other people came (without orders): Bagginses,\nand Boffins, and Bolgers, and Tooks, and other guests that lived or\nwere staying near. By mid-day, when even the best-fed were out and\nabout again, there was a large crowd at Bag End, uninvited but not\nunexpected.\nFrodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired\nand worried. He welcomed all the callers, but he had not much more\nto say than before. His reply to all inquiries was simply this: ‘Mr.\nBilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as I know, for good.’ Some of\nthe visitors he invited to come inside, as Bilbo had left ‘messages’\nfor them.\nInside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages\nand parcels and small articles of furniture. On every item there was\na label tied. There were several labels of this sort:\nFor ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo; on an\numbrella. Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones.\nFor DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with\nlove from Bilbo; on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo’s\nsister and the eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she\nwas ninety-nine, and had written reams of good advice for more than\nhalf a century.\nFor MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B.; on a\ngold pen and ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.\nFor ANGELICA’S use, from Uncle Bilbo; on a round convex mirror.\nShe was a young Baggins, and too obviously considered her face\nshapely.\nFor the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor;on\nan (empty) book-case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and\nworse than usual at returning them.\nFor LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT; on a\ncase of silver spoons. Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good\nmany of his spoons, while he was away on his former journey. Lobelia\nknew that quite well. When she arrived later in the day, she took the\npoint at once, but she also took the spoons.\nThis is only a small selection of the assembled presents. Bilbo’s\nresidence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his\nlong life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for\nwhich the custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely\nresponsible. Not, of course, that the birthday-presents were always\nnew; there were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that had\ncirculated all around the district; but Bilbo had usually given new'}
{'62': 'Every one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out per-\nsonally by Bilbo, and several had some point, or some joke. But, of\ncourse, most of the things were given where they would be wanted\nand welcome. The poorer hobbits, and especially those of Bagshot\nRow, did very well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes,\na new spade, a woollen waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creak-\ning joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality,\ngot a dozen bottles of Old Winyards: a strong red wine from the\nSouthfarthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid down by\nBilbo’s father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted him a capital\nfellow after the first bottle.\nThere was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, all\nthe chief treasures, as well as the books, pictures, and more than\nenough furniture, were left in his possession. There was, however,\nno sign nor mention of money or jewellery: not a penny-piece or a\nglass bead was given away.\nFrodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that\nthe whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire;\nand before long the place was packed with people who had no\nbusiness there, but could not be kept out. Labels got torn off and\nmixed, and quarrels broke out. Some people tried to do swaps and\ndeals in the hall; and others tried to make off with minor items\nnot addressed to them, or with anything that seemed unwanted or\nunwatched. The road to the gate was blocked with barrows and\nhandcarts.\nIn the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived.\nFrodo had retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck\nto keep an eye on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo,\nMerry bowed politely.\n‘He is indisposed,’ he said. ‘He is resting.’\n‘Hiding, you mean,’ said Lobelia. ‘Anyway we want to see him\nand we mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!’\nMerry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to\ndiscover their parting gift of spoons. It did not improve their tempers.\nEventually they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a\ntable with a lot of papers in front of him. He looked indisposed – to\nsee Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with\nsomething in his pocket. But he spoke quite politely.\nThe Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began by\noffering him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various valu-\nable and unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only the things'}
{'63': '‘Only one thing is clear to me,’ said Otho, ‘and that is that you\nare doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.’\nOtho would have been Bilbo’s heir, but for the adoption of\nFrodo. He read the will carefully and snorted. It was, unfortunately,\nvery clear and correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits,\nwhich demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses in\nred ink).\n‘Foiled again!’ he said to his wife. ‘And after waiting sixty years.\nSpoons? Fiddlesticks!’ He snapped his fingers under Frodo’s nose\nand stumped off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little\nlater Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on,\nand found her still about the place, investigating nooks and corners,\nand tapping the floors. He escorted her firmly off the premises, after\nhe had relieved her of several small (but rather valuable) articles that\nhad somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her face looked as if she\nwas in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark;\nbut all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:\n‘You’ll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn’t you go too? You\ndon’t belong here; you’re no Baggins – you – you’re a Brandybuck!’\n‘Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,’ said\nFrodo as he shut the door on her.\n‘It was a compliment,’ said Merry Brandybuck, ‘and so, of course,\nnot true.’\nThen they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits\n(two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls of\none of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho\nProudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot’s grandson), who had begun an exca-\nvation in the larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo. The\nlegend of Bilbo’s gold excited both curiosity and hope; for legendary\ngold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as every-\none knows, anyone’s for the finding – unless the search is interrupted.\nWhen he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out, Frodo col-\nlapsed on a chair in the hall. ‘It’s time to close the shop, Merry,’ he\nsaid. ‘Lock the door, and don’t open it to anyone today, not even if\nthey bring a battering ram.’ Then he went to revive himself with a\nbelated cup of tea.\nHe had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the\nfront-door. ‘Lobelia again most likely,’ he thought. ‘She must have\nthought of something really nasty, and have come back again to say\nit. It can wait.’\nHe went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much louder,'}
{'64': '‘If you don’t let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down\nyour hole and out through the hill,’ he said.\n‘My dear Gandalf ! Half a minute!’ cried Frodo, running out of\nthe room to the door. ‘Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.’\n‘Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-\ntrap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.’\n‘She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on\nBilbo’s ring. I longed to disappear.’\n‘Don’t do that!’ said Gandalf, sitting down. ‘Do be careful of that\nring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say a\nlast word.’\n‘Well, what about it?’\n‘What do you know already?’\n‘Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he found\nit, and how he used it: on his journey, I mean.’\n‘Which story, I wonder,’ said Gandalf.\n‘Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,’ said Frodo.\n‘He told me the true story soon after I came to live here. He said\nyou had pestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. ‘‘No\nsecrets between us, Frodo,’’ he said; ‘‘but they are not to go any\nfurther. It’s mine anyway.’’ ’\n‘That’s interesting,’ said Gandalf. ‘Well, what did you think of it\nall?’\n‘If you mean, inventing all that about a ‘‘present’’, well, I thought\nthe true story much more likely, and I couldn’t see the point of\naltering it at all. It was very unlike Bilbo to do so, anyway; and I\nthought it rather odd.’\n‘So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such\ntreasures – if they use them. Let it be a warning to you to be very\ncareful with it. It may have other powers than just making you vanish\nwhen you wish to.’\n‘I don’t understand,’ said Frodo.\n‘Neither do I,’ answered the wizard. ‘I have merely begun to\nwonder about the ring, especially since last night. No need to worry.\nBut if you take my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all.\nAt least I beg you not to use it in any way that will cause talk or\nrouse suspicion. I say again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!’\n‘You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of ?’\n‘I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell you\nsomething when I come back. I am going off at once: so this is\ngood-bye for the present.’ He got up.\n‘At once!’ cried Frodo. ‘Why, I thought you were staying on for'}
